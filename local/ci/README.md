# CI local plugin

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/moodlehq/moodle-local_ci.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/moodlehq/moodle-local_ci)

This local_ci plugin contains all the scripts needed
by Moodle CI servers to automate checks while
integration happens.

## Dependencies

+ Some checks require a MySQL, master-based site to be up and running.
+ Some checks require a PHP engine to run (other are pure shell scripts).
+ Some checks require the installation of 3rd part tools (phpunit...).
+ Some checks require the presence of both local_codechecker and local_moodlecheck local plugins.
+ You can run them standalone or also with the ease and functionalities coming with different tools like:
    - Jenkins: http://jenkins-php.org
    - Travis: https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/php/
    - Docker: https://github.com/moodlehq/moodle-php-apache
    - ...

## TODO

+ Complete the documentation.
+ Document each check properly.
