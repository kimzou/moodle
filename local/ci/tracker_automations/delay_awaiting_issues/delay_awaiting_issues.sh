This rigid timeframe on each integration/testing cycle aims to produce a better and clear separation and organization of tasks for everybody.

This is a bulk-automated message, so if you want to blame somebody/thing/where don't do it here (use git instead) :-D :-P

Apologies for the inconvenience, this might be integrated next week. Thanks for your collaboration & ciao :-)"}
